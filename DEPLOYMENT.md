# NostrResearch Deployment Guide

This guide covers all deployment options for the NostrResearch platform.

## üöÄ Quick Deploy Options

### 1. Netlify (Recommended - Easiest)

**One-Click Deploy:**
[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/yourusername/nostrresearch)

**Manual Deploy:**
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect GitHub to Netlify
3. Set build command: `npm run build`
4. Set publish directory: `dist`
5. Deploy automatically on every commit

**Custom Domain:**
- Add your domain in Netlify settings
- Update DNS to point to Netlify
- SSL certificate is automatic

### 2. Vercel (Great Performance)

**One-Click Deploy:**
[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/yourusername/nostrresearch)

**Manual Deploy:**
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Import project to Vercel
3. Auto-detects Vite configuration
4. Deploys automatically

### 3. GitHub Pages (Free)

**Setup:**
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Go to repository Settings ‚Üí Pages
3. Select "GitHub Actions" as source
4. The workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy-gh-pages.yml` will handle deployment
5. Site will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io/nostrresearch`

### 4. Nostr-Native Deployment (Decentralized)

**Deploy to Nostr Protocol:**
```bash
npm run deploy
```

This uses `nostr-deploy-cli` to publish your site directly to Nostr relays, making it truly decentralized and censorship-resistant.

## üåê Production Deployment Options

### Option A: Traditional Web Hosting

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Easy to access (regular URLs)
- ‚úÖ Better SEO and discoverability
- ‚úÖ Familiar to users
- ‚úÖ Fast global CDN
- ‚úÖ Custom domains

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Centralized hosting
- ‚ùå Can be censored/taken down
- ‚ùå Requires traditional infrastructure

**Best For:** Maximum user adoption and accessibility

### Option B: Nostr-Native Hosting

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Truly decentralized
- ‚úÖ Censorship-resistant
- ‚úÖ Aligned with Nostr philosophy
- ‚úÖ No hosting costs
- ‚úÖ Community-owned infrastructure

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Requires Nostr-compatible browser/client
- ‚ùå Less discoverable
- ‚ùå Newer technology
- ‚ùå Limited SEO

**Best For:** Nostr-native users and maximum decentralization

### Option C: Hybrid Deployment (Recommended)

Deploy to **both** traditional web and Nostr:

1. **Primary Site:** Netlify/Vercel for broad accessibility
2. **Nostr Mirror:** Nostr deployment for decentralization
3. **Cross-Promotion:** Link between both versions

## üîß Self-Hosting Options

### Docker Deployment

**Single Container:**
```bash
docker build -t nostrresearch .
docker run -p 3000:80 nostrresearch
```

**Docker Compose:**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### VPS Deployment

**Requirements:**
- Ubuntu 20.04+ or similar
- 1GB RAM minimum
- Node.js 18+
- Nginx (optional, for reverse proxy)

**Steps:**
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nostrresearch.git
cd nostrresearch

# Install dependencies and build
npm install
npm run build

# Serve with nginx or any static file server
sudo cp -r dist/* /var/www/html/
```

## üåç Domain and DNS Setup

### Custom Domain Configuration

**For Netlify:**
1. Add domain in Netlify dashboard
2. Update DNS records:
   ```
   Type: CNAME

   Type: A
   Name: @
   Value: 75.2.60.5
   ```

**For Vercel:**
1. Add domain in Vercel dashboard
2. Update DNS records as provided by Vercel

**For Self-Hosting:**
1. Point A record to your server IP
2. Configure SSL with Let's Encrypt:
   ```bash
   sudo certbot --nginx -d nostrresearch.com
   ```

## üìä Monitoring and Analytics

### Performance Monitoring
- **Vercel Analytics:** Built-in performance metrics
